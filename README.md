## How it works
The AI Basketball Referee is a computer vision-based system that uses a custom YOLO (You Only Look Once) machine learning model trained on 3000 annotated images to detect basketballs in real-time. Additionally, it utilizes YOLO pose estimation to detect keypoints on the body of the players. By combining these two techniques, the AI Basketball Referee is capable of accurately identifying travels and double dribbles in basketball games.
